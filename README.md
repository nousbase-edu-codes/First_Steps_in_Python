# First_Steps_in_Python
First Steps in Python Beginner-friendly Python notebooks designed to teach programming through small programs, clear thinking, and a guided real-world project.

**First Steps in Python**

This repository contains the official companion code for the book “First Steps in Python”.

The goal of this repository is not to showcase advanced Python tricks, but to help absolute beginners write real Python code, understand how programs think, and gain confidence by doing.

All code is written in Jupyter Notebooks so that learners can read, run, modify, and experiment in one place.

**What This Repository Is For**

Beginners who are learning Python for the first time

Learners who once knew Python but forgot the basics

Students following the First Steps in Python book

Anyone who prefers learning by typing and experimenting

**This repository follows the same learning philosophy as the book:**

1. One concept at a time

2. Small, readable programs

3. Step-by-step thinking

4. No unnecessary shortcuts

**Notebooks Explained**
1️. **First_Steps_in_Python.ipynb**

This notebook contains chapter-wise code examples from the book.

You will find:

1. Small programs demonstrating each concept

2. Code written in a simple, readable style

3. Examples covering:

   3.1 Basic programming ideas

   3.2 Variables and data types

   3.3 Conditions and loops

   3.4 Collections like lists and dictionaries


**Important:
You are strongly encouraged to type the code yourself instead of copy-pasting.**

**2️. sci-mate_project.ipynb**

This notebook contains the final guided project from the book.

**Project Theme:**
A simple management system for a fictional club called Sci-Mate.

Through this project, you will learn:

How to break a real problem into steps

How to store and manage data using pandas

How CRUD operations work:

Create

Read

Update

Delete (soft delete using active status)

How multiple concepts come together in one program

This project is designed to connect all the dots and prepare you for building your own small Python programs.

**How to Learn Effectively**

Go slow

Type every line

Break problems into steps

Revisit earlier cells without guilt

Modify code and observe what changes

Mistakes are not errors — they are part of learning.
